Mutation alt
     //just mutating and not copying. need to send a copy
      //compare the
      //console.log(newState);
      //(todos[i].id) look for the id in each todo in the array of todos.

look in mdn bookmarked tabs to figure out method for searching for ID in index todo object

      //map through the data we're sending over from the alert handleSave which is sending id, text and priority 
      //make a copy of todos
      //find the index where that id is, inside the copy of todos, use findindex
      //change the text and priority
      //update state with copy
